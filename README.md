# Example of a simple router inspired by next app router
- Just add routes
- Font and shadcn/ui with tailwindv4 set up
- Search params suppourted just import @/lib/router 
- Dynamic routes suppourt
- No configs - deploys to vercel or anything out of the box
- Uses rolldown vite and vite plugin react oxc for super speed - 300ms build times - sadly tsc is slow
